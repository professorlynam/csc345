    "title": "Style Guide",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Coding style refers to how you name your objects and functions, how you comment your code, how you use spacing throughout your code, etc. If your coding style is consistent, your code is easier to read and easier to debug as a result. Many companies enforce a specific coding style, and you won’t be able to push your code to the code base if your code does not pass the style check.\nThis style guide is a list of dos and don’ts for Python programs. In this course, style will be enforced (meaning you will be graded on it) only for programming projects.\n\nCSc 110: Style Guide\n\nFile Comments\nFile comments, also called header comments, are a required piece of your program. This belongs at the top of your code. Your name, the course title, the class section you are in, the assignment, and a brief description of your program should be located in the file comments. Below is an outline for reference.\n'''\nJane Doe\nCSC110\nProject -1\nThis program has a single function that computes the sum of two numbers.\n'''\n\nNote that three double-quotes surround the header comments (you can also use three single-quotes).\nThese are docstrings; they are utilized in Python to document your code.\nDocstrings should be organized and easy to read.\nRemember: you are writing code for others and your future self to read!\n\n\n\nFunction Comments\nEvery function created is required to have a function comment, including main. Function comments serve to describe the task the function performs. The function arguments and return should be included. Please follow the example below for reference.\ndef divide(x, y):\n    '''\n    This function returns the integer division of its two parameters.\n    Args:\n        x: the integer dividend.\n        y: the integer divisor.\n    Returns:\n        The integer division of x and y.\n    '''\n    return x // y\n\nNote the triple-quotes (docstrings) that surround the function comments.\nThe function comments are located inside the function they describe, before any code.\nFunction comments must contain a description of the function, the arguments, and the return value.\nThe description of parameters should include their types and purpose.\nThe description of the return value should include its type and what it represents.\nIf the function has no arguments or return, document that in the docstrings.\n\ndef func():\n    '''\n    This function prints the character char N times.\n    Args:\n        None.\n    Returns:\n        None.\n    '''\n    print(\"This is an example.\")\n\nThe template above should be followed when there are no arguments or return values in a function.\nPlease note that information about both arguments and return values are included in function comments, even if there are none in the function.\n\n\n\nIn-line Comments\nFor any line of code that is more complex (for example, a conditional statement or for loop), add an in-line comment before that line of code. In-line comments start with # and have a space after #:\ndef func(n):\n    '''\n    This function prints the character char N times.\n    Args:\n        None.\n    Returns:\n        None.\n    '''\n    print(\"This is an example.\")\n    \n    # checks if argument n is an even number\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n      print(\"even\")\nIf you need multiple lines of in-line comments, use line breaks, and start each line with # followed by a space. Remember that all lines in your code, including comments, should be 80 characters or less.\ndef func(numbers):\n    '''\n    This function prints the character char N times.\n    Args:\n        None.\n    Returns:\n        None.\n    '''\n    print(\"This is an example.\")\n    \n    # iterate over indices in numbers list backwards\n    # starting from the ending, all the all to zero\n    # with step -1\n    for i in range(len(numbers)-1, -1, -1):\n      # check if item at i position is even\n      if numbers[i] % 2 == 0:\n        numbers.pop(i) # remove even item at index i\nIf you need more information on when to comment your code, read this post on Best practices for writing code comments.\n\n\nOther formatting\n\nWhen formatting a docstring, follow the template above.\nDescription of the function should be first.\nA function’s description should describe the purpose of the function, not the implementation of it.\nArguments and information about them should follow the description of the function.\nThe return value is the last piece of information in the docstring.\n\n\n\nVariables and Line Length\nVariable names should follow typical Python style requirements. Variables should only consist of lower-case letters, numbers, and underscores. Variables should be indicative of what they represent. Below are examples of good variable naming and poor variable naming.\n# Good examples of variable names.\ncount = 1\nproduct = count*3\nword = \"Hello\"\nname = \"Zuko\"\nemployee_salary = \"70000\"\n\n# Poor examples of variable names.\nx = 1\n1proDUCT = count*3\nword_GREETING = \"Hello\"\nxyz = 2\n__name = \"Zuko\"\nemployeeSalary = \"70000\"\nSimilarly to function comments, code should be easy to read. This can be done by breaking pieces of code into groups. If several lines of code relate to the same task, put them together with no spaces inbetween and use spacing to separate them from other groupings.\nAll lines of code should be 80 characters or less. If there is a line of code that exceeds that length, it should be rewritten to be two statements. The backslash character (\\) can also be used to continue the statement onto the next line.\n\n\nReference\nThis guide is derived from Todd Proebsting’s CSc 110 style guide, which is very loosely based on Google’s Style Guide.",

    "text": "There will be situations where your program has to interact with the user. For example, you would want to take input from the user and then print some results back. We can achieve this using the input() function and print function respectively.\nExample:\ndef reverse(text):\n    return text[::-1]\n\n\ndef is_palindrome(text):\n    return text == reverse(text)\n\n\nsomething = input(\"Enter text: \")\nif is_palindrome(something):\n    print(\"Yes, it is a palindrome\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No, it is not a palindrome\")\nOutput:\n\nEnter text: sir\nNo, it is not a palindrome\n\n$ python3 io_input.py\nEnter text: madam\nYes, it is a palindrome\n\n$ python3 io_input.py\nEnter text: racecar\nYes, it is a palindrome\n\nHow It Works\nWe use the slicing feature to reverse the text. We’ve already seen how we can make slices from sequences using the seq[a:b] code starting from position a to position b. We can also provide a third argument that determines the step by which the slicing is done. The default step is 1 because of which it returns a continuous part of the text. Giving a negative step, i.e., -1 will return the text in reverse.\nThe input() function takes a string as argument and displays it to the user. Then it waits for the user to type something and press the return key. Once the user has entered and pressed the return key, the input() function will then return that text the user has entered.\nWe take that text and reverse it. If the original text and reversed text are equal, then the text is a palindrome.\n\n\nChecking whether a text is a palindrome should also ignore punctuation, spaces and case. For example, “Rise to vote, sir.” is also a palindrome but our current program doesn’t say it is. Can you improve the above program to recognize this palindrome?\nIf you need a hint, the idea is that…1"

    "text": "Most statements (logical lines) that you write will contain expressions. A simple example of an expression is 2 + 3. An expression can be broken down into operators and operands.\nOperators are functionality that do something and can be represented by symbols such as + or by special keywords. Operators require some data to operate on and such data is called operands. In this case, 2 and 3 are the operands.\n\n\nWe will briefly take a look at the operators and their usage.\nNote that you can evaluate the expressions given in the examples using the interpreter interactively. For example, to test the expression 2 + 3, use the interactive Python interpreter prompt:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 + 3\n5\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 * 5\n15\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\nHere is a quick overview of the available operators:\n\n+ (plus)\n\nAdds two objects\n3 + 5 gives 8. 'a' + 'b' gives 'ab'.\n\n- (minus)\n\nGives the subtraction of one number from the other; if the first operand is absent it is assumed to be zero.\n-5.2 gives a negative number and 50 - 24 gives 26.\n\n* (multiply)\n\nGives the multiplication of the two numbers or returns the string repeated that many times.\n2 * 3 gives 6. 'la' * 3 gives 'lalala'.\n\n** (power)\n\nReturns x to the power of y\n3 ** 4 gives 81 (i.e. 3 * 3 * 3 * 3)\n\n/ (divide)\n\nDivide x by y\n13 / 3 gives 4.333333333333333\n\n// (divide and floor)\n\nDivide x by y and round the answer down to the nearest integer value. Note that if one of the values is a float, you’ll get back a float.\n13 // 3 gives 4\n-13 // 3 gives -5\n9//1.81 gives 4.0\n\n% (modulo)\n\nReturns the remainder of the division\n13 % 3 gives 1. -25.5 % 2.25 gives 1.5.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you had an expression such as 2 + 3 * 4, is the addition done first or the multiplication? Our high school maths tells us that the multiplication should be done first. This means that the multiplication operator has higher precedence than the addition operator.\nThe following table gives the precedence table for Python, from the highest precedence to the lowest precedence. This means that in a given expression, Python will first evaluate the operators and expressions first in the table before the ones listed last in the table. It is far better to use parentheses to group operators and operands appropriately in order to explicitly specify the precedence. This makes the program more readable.\n\n(expressions...)\n** : Exponentiation\n*, /, //, % : Multiplication, Division, Floor Division and Remainder\n+, - : Addition and subtraction\n\nOperators with the same precedence are listed in the same row in the above table. For example, + and - have the same precedence.\n\n\n\nTo make the expressions more readable, we can use parentheses. For example, 2 + (3 * 4) is definitely easier to understand than 2 + 3 * 4 which requires knowledge of the operator precedences. As with everything else, the parentheses should be used reasonably (do not overdo it) and should not be redundant, as in (2 + (3 * 4)).\nThere is an additional advantage to using parentheses - it helps us to change the order of evaluation. For example, if you want addition to be evaluated before multiplication in an expression, then you can write something like (2 + 3) * 4.\n\n\n\nOperators are usually associated from left to right. This means that operators with the same precedence are evaluated in a left to right manner. For example, 2 + 3 + 4 is evaluated as (2 + 3) + 4.\n\n\n\nExample:\nlength = 5\nbreadth = 2\n\narea = length * breadth\nprint('Area is', area)\nprint('Perimeter is', 2 * (length + breadth))\nOutput:\nArea is 10\nPerimeter is 14\nHow It Works\nThe length and breadth of the rectangle are stored in variables by the same name. We use these to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle with the help of expressions. We store the result of the expression length * breadth in the variable area and then print it using the print function. In the second case, we directly use the value of the expression 2 * (length + breadth) in the print function.\nAlso, notice how Python pretty-prints the output. Even though we have not specified a space between 'Area is' and the variable area, Python puts it for us so that we get a clean nice output and the program is much more readable this way (since we don’t need to worry about spacing in the strings we use for output). This is an example of how Python makes life easy for the programmer.\n\n\n\nThe built-in python function round returns an integer if ndigits (number of digits) is omitted. Otherwise the return value has the same type as the number provided as argument (if the number is an integer, round returns an integer, if the number is a float, round returns a float). This function is useful to return a float number rounded to the decimal places provided as the second argument when calling it. The syntax is round(number, ndigits)\nround(50.5555, 2)\nThe call above returns 50.56\nPython uses the IEEE 754 standard for rounding, called the banker’s rounding. So python rounds to the nearest even number if the fractional component of the number is halfway between two integers. The idea is that 50% of the numbers are rounded up and 50% down.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; round(50.5)\n50\n&gt;&gt;&gt; round(51.5)\n52\nNote that decimal fractions often cannot be represented exactly as a binary floating-point number, so the return value of round is not always what you’d expect (not a bug).\n&gt;&gt;&gt; round(4.675, 2)\n4.67\n&gt;&gt;&gt; round(4.665, 2)\n4.67\nIf you are curious, you can read more about floating point arithmetic.\n\n\n\nWe have seen how to use operators, operands and expressions - these are the basic building blocks of any program.

    "text": "Input and Output\nAnother common type of input/output (besides using the input() function) is dealing with files. The ability to create, read and write files is essential to many programs and we will explore this aspect in this chapter.\nYou can open and use files for reading or writing by creating an object of the file class and using its read, readline or write methods appropriately to read from or write to the file. The ability to read or write to the file depends on the mode you have specified for the file opening. Then finally, when you are finished with the file, you call the close method to tell Python that we are done using the file.\nExample:\npoem = '''\\\nProgramming is fun\nWhen the work is done\nif you wanna make your work also fun:\n    use Python!\n'''\n\n# Open for 'w'riting\nf = open('poem.txt', 'w')\n# Write text to file\nf.write(poem)\n# Close the file\nf.close()\n\n# If no mode is specified,\n# 'r'ead mode is assumed by default\nf = open('poem.txt')\nwhile True:\n    line = f.readline()\n    # Zero length indicates EOF\n    if len(line) == 0:\n        break\n    # The `line` already has a newline\n    # at the end of each line\n    # since it is reading from a file.\n    print(line, end='')\n# close the file\nf.close()\nOutput:\n\nProgramming is fun\nWhen the work is done\nif you wanna make your work also fun:\n    use Python!\n\nHow It Works\nNote that we can create a new file object simply by using the open method. We open (or create it if it doesn’t already exist) this file by using the built-in open function and specifying the name of the file and the mode in which we want to open the file. The mode can be a read mode ('r'), write mode ('w') or append mode ('a'). We can also specify whether we are reading, writing, or appending in text mode ('t') or binary mode ('b'). There are actually many more modes available and help(open) will give you more details about them. By default, open() considers the file to be a ’t’ext file and opens it in ’r’ead mode.\nIn our example, we first open/create the file in write text mode and use the write method of the file object to write our string variable poem to the file and then we finally close the file.\nNext, we open the same file again for reading. We don’t need to specify a mode because ‘read text file’ is the default mode. We read in each line of the file using the readline method in a loop. This method returns a complete line including the newline character at the end of the line. When an empty string is returned, it means that we have reached the end of the file and we ‘break’ out of the loop.\nIn the end, we finally close the file.\nWe can see from our readline output that this program has indeed written to and read from our new poem.txt file."

Minimally, you need a plain text editor (for example, TextEdit for Macs and Notepad++ for Windows) and a terminal/command prompt to run python.\nIdeally, you will be using an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) which facilitates coding by integrating a text editor, a console and other tools into one window. IDEs offer great tools like autocomplete and debugging.\n\nBasic Steps\n\nOpen your editor of choice.\nType the program code given in the example.\nSave it as a file with the filename mentioned.\nRun the interpreter with the command python program.py to run the program.",

First, we assign the literal constant value 5 to the variable i using the assignment operator (=). This line is called a statement because it states that something should be done and in this case, we connect the variable name i to the value 5. Next, we print the value of i using the print statement which, unsurprisingly, just prints the value of the variable to the screen.\nThen we add 1 to the value stored in i and store it back. We then print it and expectedly, we get the value 6.\nSimilarly, we assign the literal string to the variable s and then print it.\n\nNote for static language programmers\nVariables are used by just assigning them a value.

    "text": "Logical And Physical Line\nA physical line is what you see when you write the program. A logical line is what Python sees as a single statement. Python implicitly assumes that each physical line corresponds to a logical line.\nAn example of a logical line is a statement like print('hello world') - if this was on a line by itself (as you see it in an editor), then this also corresponds to a physical line.\nImplicitly, Python encourages the use of a single statement per line which makes code more readable.\nIf you want to specify more than one logical line on a single physical line, then you have to explicitly specify this using a semicolon (;) which indicates the end of a logical line/statement. For example:\ni = 5\nprint(i)\nis effectively same as\ni = 5;\nprint(i);\nwhich is also same as\ni = 5; print(i);\nand same as\ni = 5; print(i)\nHowever, I strongly recommend that you stick to writing a maximum of a single logical line on each single physical line. The idea is that you should never use the semicolon. In fact, I have never used or even seen a semicolon in a Python program.\nThere is one kind of situation where this concept is really useful: if you have a long line of code, you can break it into multiple physical lines by using the backslash. This is referred to as explicit line joining:\ns = 'This is a string. \\\nThis continues the string.'\nprint(s)\nOutput:\nThis is a string. This continues the string.\nSimilarly,\ni = \\\n5\nis the same as\ni = 5\nSometimes, there is an implicit assumption where you don’t need to use a backslash. This is the case where the logical line has a starting parentheses, starting square brackets or a starting curly braces but not an ending one. This is called implicit line joining.",

    "section": "Indentation",
    "text": "Indentation\nWhitespace is important in Python. Actually, whitespace at the beginning of the line is important. This is called indentation. Leading whitespace (spaces and tabs) at the beginning of the logical line is used to determine the indentation level of the logical line, which in turn is used to determine the grouping of statements.\nThis means that statements which go together must have the same indentation. Each such set of statements is called a block. We will see examples of how blocks are important in later chapters.\nOne thing you should remember is that wrong indentation can give rise to errors. For example:\ni = 5\n# Error below! Notice a single space at the start of the line\n print('Value is', i)\nprint('I repeat, the value is', i)\nWhen you run this, you get the following error:\n  File \"whitespace.py\", line 3\n    print('Value is', i)\n    ^\nIndentationError: unexpected indent\nNotice that there is a single space at the beginning of the second line. The error indicated by Python tells us that the syntax of the program is invalid i.e. the program was not properly written. What this means to you is that you cannot arbitrarily start new blocks of statements (except for the default main block which you have been using all along, of course). Cases where you can use new blocks will be detailed in later chapters such as the control flow.\n\nHow to indent\nUse four spaces for indentation. This is the official Python language recommendation. Good editors will automatically do this for you. Make sure you use a consistent number of spaces for indentation, otherwise your program will not run or will have unexpected behavior.\n\n\n\nNote to static language programmers\nPython will always use indentation for blocks and will never use braces.",

    "text": "Functions are reusable pieces of programs. They allow you to give a name to a block of statements, allowing you to run that block using the specified name anywhere in your program and any number of times. This is known as calling the function. We have already used many built-in functions such as len and range.\nThe function concept is probably the most important building block of any non-trivial software (in any programming language), so we will explore various aspects of functions in this chapter.\nFunctions are defined using the def keyword. After this keyword comes an identifier name for the function, followed by a pair of parentheses which may enclose some names of variables, and by the final colon that ends the line. Next follows the block of statements that are part of this function. An example will show that this is actually very simple:\nExample:\ndef say_hello():\n    # block belonging to the function\n    print('hello world')\n# End of function\n\nsay_hello()  # call the function\nsay_hello()  # call the function again\nOutput:\n\nhello world\nhello world\n\nHow It Works\nWe define a function called say_hello using the syntax as explained above. This function takes no parameters and hence there are no variables declared in the parentheses. Parameters to functions are just input to the function so that we can pass in different values to it and get back corresponding results.\nNotice that we can call the same function twice which means we do not have to write the same code again.\n\n\nA function can take parameters, which are values you supply to the function so that the function can do something utilizing those values. These parameters are just like variables except that the values of these variables are defined when we call the function and are already assigned values when the function runs.\nParameters are specified within the pair of parentheses in the function definition, separated by commas. When we call the function, we supply the values in the same way. Note the terminology used - the names given in the function definition are called parameters whereas the values you supply in the function call are called arguments.\nExample:\ndef print_add_10(value):\n    x = value + 10\n    print(x)\n# End of function\n\nprint_add_10(2)  # call the function with integer as a parameter\nprint_add_10(10)  # call the function again with different parameter\nOutput:\n\n12\n20\n\nHow It Works\nHere, we define a function called print_add_10 that uses one parameters called value. We create a new variable x that hold the evaluation of the value plus 10 and we printn the value in x.\nThe first time we call the function print_add_10, we directly supply 2 as an argument. In the second case, we call the function with the value 10 as an argument.\n\n\n\nWhen you declare variables inside a function definition, they are not related in any way to other variables with the same names used outside the function - i.e. variable names are local to the function. This is called the scope of the variable. All variables have the scope of the block they are declared in starting from the point of definition of the name.\nExample:\nx = 50\n\ndef func(x):\n    print('x is', x)\n    x = 2\n    print('Changed local x to', x)\n\n\nfunc(x)\nprint('x is still', x)\nOutput:\n\nx is 50\nChanged local x to 2\nx is still 50\n\nHow It Works\nThe first time that we print the value of the name x with the first line in the function’s body, Python uses the value of the parameter declared in the main block, above the function definition.\nNext, we assign the value 2 to x. The name x is local to our function. So, when we change the value of x in the function, the x defined in the main block remains unaffected.\nWith the last print statement, we display the value of x as defined in the main block, thereby confirming that it is actually unaffected by the local assignment within the previously called function.\n\n\n\nFor some functions, you may want to make some parameters optional and use default values in case the user does not want to provide values for them. This is done with the help of default argument values. You can specify default argument values for parameters by appending to the parameter name in the function definition the assignment operator (=) followed by the default value.\nNote that the default argument value should be a constant. More precisely, the default argument value should be immutable - this is explained in detail in later chapters. For now, just remember this.\nExample:\ndef say(message, times=1):\n    print(message * times)\n\nsay('Hello')\nsay('World', 5)\nOutput:\n\nHello\nWorldWorldWorldWorldWorld\n\nHow It Works\nThe function named say is used to print a string as many times as specified. If we don’t supply a value, then by default, the string is printed just once. We achieve this by specifying a default argument value of 1 to the parameter times.\nIn the first usage of say, we supply only the string and it prints the string once. In the second usage of say, we supply both the string and an argument 5 stating that we want to say the string message 5 times.\n\nCAUTION\nOnly those parameters which are at the end of the parameter list can be given default argument values i.e. you cannot have a parameter with a default argument value preceding a parameter without a default argument value in the function’s parameter list.\nThis is because the values are assigned to the parameters by position. For example,def func(a, b=5) is valid, but def func(a=5, b) is not valid.\n\n\n\n\nThe return statement is used to return from a function i.e. break out of the function. We can optionally return a value from the function as well.\nExample:\ndef add_10(value):\n    x = value + 10\n    return x\n# End of function\n\nresult = add_10(5)\nprint(result)\nOutput:\n\n15\n\nHow It Works\nThe add_10 function returns the parameter value added 10.\nNote that a return statement without a value is equivalent to return None. None is a special type in Python that represents nothingness. For example, it is used to indicate that a variable has no value if it has a value of None.\nEvery function implicitly contains a return None statement at the end unless you have written your own return statement. You can see this by running print(some_function()) where the function some_function does not use the return statement such as:\ndef some_function():\n    pass\nThe pass statement is used in Python to indicate an empty block of statements.\n\n\n\nWe have seen so many aspects of functions but note that we still haven’t covered all aspects of them."

This basically translates to say that you should use only simple objects for keys.\nPairs of keys and values are specified in a dictionary by using the notation d = {key1 : value1, key2 : value2 }. Notice that the key-value pairs are separated by a colon and the pairs are separated themselves by commas and all this is enclosed in a pair of curly braces.\nRemember that key-value pairs in a dictionary are not ordered in any manner. If you want a particular order, then you will have to sort them yourself before using it.\nThe dictionaries that you will be using are instances/objects of the dict class.\nExample:\n# 'ab' is short for 'a'ddress'b'ook\n\nab = {\n    'Swaroop': 'swaroop@swaroopch.com',\n    'Larry': 'larry@wall.org',\n    'Matsumoto': 'matz@ruby-lang.org',\n    'Spammer': 'spammer@hotmail.com'\n}\n\nprint(\"Swaroop's address is\", ab['Swaroop'])\n\n# Deleting a key-value pair\ndel ab['Spammer']\n\nprint('There are', len(ab), 'contacts in the address-book')\n\n# Adding a key-value pair\nab['Guido'] = 'guido@python.org'\n\nif 'Guido' in ab:\n    print(\"\\nGuido's address is\", ab['Guido'])\nOutput:\n\nSwaroop's address is swaroop@swaroopch.com\nThere are 3 contacts in the address-book\n\nGuido's address is guido@python.org\n\nHow It Works\nWe create the dictionary ab using the notation already discussed. We then access key-value pairs by specifying the key using the indexing operator as discussed in the context of lists and tuples. Observe the simple syntax.\nWe can delete key-value pairs using our old friend - the del statement. We simply specify the dictionary and the indexing operator for the key to be removed and pass it to the del statement. There is no need to know the value corresponding to the key for this operation.\nWe can add new key-value pairs by simply using the indexing operator to access a key and assign that value, as we have done for Guido in the above case.\nWe can check if a key-value pair exists using the in operator.\nFor the list of methods of the dict class, see help(dict).\n\nKeyword Arguments and Dictionaries\nIf you have used keyword arguments in your functions, you have already used dictionaries! Just think about it - the key-value pair is specified by you in the parameter list of the function definition and when you access variables within your function, it is just a key access of a dictionary (which is called the symbol table in compiler design terminology)."

    "text": "In the programs we have seen till now, there has always been a series of statements faithfully executed by Python in exact top-down order. What if you wanted to change the flow of how it works? For example, you want the program to take some decisions and do different things depending on different situations, such as printing ‘Good Morning’ or ‘Good Evening’ depending on the time of the day?\nAs you might have guessed, this is achieved using control flow statements.\n\n\nThe if statement is used to check a condition: if the condition is true, we run a block of statements (called the if-block), else we process another block of statements (called the else-block). The else clause is optional.\nExample:\nnumber = 23\nguess = int(input('Enter an integer : '))\n\nif guess == number:\n    # New block starts here\n    print('Congratulations, you guessed it.')\n    print('(but you do not win any prizes!)')\n    # New block ends here\nelif guess &lt; number:\n    # Another block\n    print('No, it is a little higher than that')\n    # You can do whatever you want in a block ...\nelse:\n    print('No, it is a little lower than that')\n    # you must have guessed &gt; number to reach here\n\nprint('Done')\n# This last statement is always executed,\n# after the if statement is executed.\nOutput:\n\nEnter an integer : 23\nCongratulations, you guessed it.\n(but you do not win any prizes!)\nDone\n\nHow It Works\nIn this program, we take guesses from the user and check if it is the number that we have. We set the variable number to any integer we want, say 23. Then, we take the user’s guess using the input() function.\nWe supply a string to the built-in input function which prints it to the screen and waits for input from the user. Once we enter something and press the enter key, the input() function returns what we entered, as a string. We then convert this string to an integer using int and then store it in the variable guess. Actually, the int is a class but all you need to know right now is that you can use it to convert a string to an integer (assuming the string contains a valid integer in the text).\nNext, we compare the guess of the user with the number we have chosen. If they are equal, we print a success message. Notice that we use indentation levels to tell Python which statements belong to which block. This is why indentation is so important in Python. I hope you are sticking to the “consistent indentation” rule. Are you?\nNotice how the if statement contains a colon at the end - we are indicating to Python that a block of statements follows.\nThen, we check if the guess is less than the number, and if so, we inform the user that they must guess a little higher than that. What we have used here is the elif clause which actually combines two related if else-if else statements into one combined if-elif-else statement. This makes the program easier and reduces the amount of indentation required.\nThe elif and else statements must also have a colon at the end of the logical line followed by their corresponding block of statements (with proper indentation, of course)\nYou can have another if statement inside the if-block of an if statement and so on - this is called a nested if statement.\nRemember that the elif and else parts are optional. A minimal valid if statement is:\nif True:\n    print('Yes, it is true')\nAfter Python has finished executing the complete if statement along with the associated elif and else clauses, it moves on to the next statement in the block containing the if statement. In this case, it is the main block (where execution of the program starts), and the next statement is the print('Done') statement. After this, Python sees the ends of the program and simply finishes up.\nEven though this is a very simple program, I have been pointing out a lot of things that you should notice. All these are pretty straightforward (and surprisingly simple for those of you from C/C++ backgrounds). You will need to become aware of all these things initially, but after some practice you will become comfortable with them, and it will all feel ‘natural’ to you.\n\nNote for C/C++ Programmers\nThere is no switch statement in Python. You can use an if..elif..else statement to do the same thing\n\n\n\n\nWe have seen how to use if statements. These are some of the most commonly used parts of Python and hence, becoming comfortable with them is essential."

You can use an if..elif..else statement to do the same thing (and in some cases, use a dictionary to do it quickly)\n\n\n\n\nThe while statement allows you to repeatedly execute a block of statements as long as a condition is true. A while statement is an example of what is called a looping statement. A while statement can have an optional else clause.\nExample (save as while.py):\n{% include \"./programs/while.py\" %}\nOutput:\n{% include \"./programs/while.txt\" %}\nHow It Works\nIn this program, we are still playing the guessing game, but the advantage is that the user is allowed to keep guessing until he guesses correctly - there is no need to repeatedly run the program for each guess, as we have done in the previous section. This aptly demonstrates the use of the while statement.\nWe move the input and if statements to inside the while loop and set the variable running to True before the while loop. First, we check if the variable running is True and then proceed to execute the corresponding while-block. After this block is executed, the condition is again checked which in this case is the running variable. If it is true, we execute the while-block again, else we continue to execute the optional else-block and then continue to the next statement.\nThe else block is executed when the while loop condition becomes False - this may even be the first time that the condition is checked. If there is an else clause for a while loop, it is always executed unless you break out of the loop with a break statement.\nThe True and False are called Boolean types and you can consider them to be equivalent to the value 1 and 0 respectively.\n\nNote for C/C++ Programmers\nRemember that you can have an else clause for the while loop.\n\n\n\n\nThe for..in statement is another looping statement which iterates over a sequence of objects i.e. go through each item in a sequence. We will see more about sequences in detail in later chapters. What you need to know right now is that a sequence is just an ordered collection of items.\nExample (save as for.py):\n{% include \"./programs/for.py\" %}\nOutput:\n{% include \"./programs/for.txt\" %}\nHow It Works\nIn this program, we are printing a sequence of numbers. We generate this sequence of numbers using the built-in range function.\nWhat we do here is supply it two numbers and range returns a sequence of numbers starting from the first number and up to the second number. For example, range(1,5) gives the sequence [1, 2, 3, 4]. By default, range takes a step count of 1. If we supply a third number to range, then that becomes the step count. For example, range(1,5,2) gives [1,3]. Remember that the range extends up to the second number i.e. it does not include the second number.\nNote that range() generates only one number at a time, if you want the full list of numbers, call list() on the range(), for example, list(range(5)) will result in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Lists are explained in the data structures chapter.\nThe for loop then iterates over this range - for i in range(1,5) is equivalent to for i in [1, 2, 3, 4] which is like assigning each number (or object) in the sequence to i, one at a time, and then executing the block of statements for each value of i. In this case, we just print the value in the block of statements.\nRemember that the else part is optional. When included, it is always executed once after the for loop is over unless a break statement is encountered.\nRemember that the for..in loop works for any sequence. Here, we have a list of numbers generated by the built-in range function, but in general we can use any kind of sequence of any kind of objects! We will explore this idea in detail in later chapters.\n\nNote for C/C++/Java/C# Programmers\nThe Python for loop is radically different from the C/C++ for loop. C# programmers will note that the for loop in Python is similar to the foreach loop in C#. Java programmers will note that the same is similar to for (int i : IntArray) in Java 1.5.\nIn C/C++, if you want to write for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++), then in Python you write just for i in range(0,5). As you can see, the for loop is simpler, more expressive and less error prone in Python.\n\n\n\n\nThe break statement is used to break out of a loop statement i.e. stop the execution of a looping statement, even if the loop condition has not become False or the sequence of items has not been completely iterated over.\nAn important note is that if you break out of a for or while loop, any corresponding loop else block is not executed.\nExample (save as break.py):\n{% include \"./programs/break.py\" %}\nOutput:\n{% include \"./programs/break.txt\" %}\nHow It Works\nIn this program, we repeatedly take the user’s input and print the length of each input each time. We are providing a special condition to stop the program by checking if the user input is 'quit'. We stop the program by breaking out of the loop and reach the end of the program.\nThe length of the input string can be found out using the built-in len function.\nRemember that the break statement can be used with the for loop as well.\nSwaroop’s Poetic Python\nThe input I have used here is a mini poem I have written:\nProgramming is fun\nWhen the work is done\nif you wanna make your work also fun:\n    use Python!\n\n\n\nThe continue statement is used to tell Python to skip the rest of the statements in the current loop block and to continue to the next iteration of the loop.\nExample (save as continue.py):\n{% include \"./programs/continue.py\" %}\nOutput:\n{% include \"./programs/continue.txt\" %}\nHow It Works\nIn this program, we accept input from the user, but we process the input string only if it is at least 3 characters long. So, we use the built-in len function to get the length and if the length is less than 3, we skip the rest of the statements in the block by using the continue statement. Otherwise, the rest of the statements in the loop are executed, doing any kind of processing we want to do here.\nNote that the continue statement works with the for loop as well.\n\n\n\nWe have seen how to use the three control flow statements - if, while and for along with their associated break and continue statements. These are some of the most commonly used parts of Python and hence, becoming comfortable with them is essential.\nNext, we will see how to create and use functions."

So, we use the built-in len function to get the length and if the length is less than 3, we skip the rest of the statements in the block by using the continue statement. Otherwise, the rest of the statements in the loop are executed, doing any kind of processing we want to do here.\nNote that the continue statement works with the for loop as well."

    "text": "Just printing hello world is not enough, is it? You want to do more than that - you want to take some input, manipulate it and get something out of it. We can achieve this in Python using constants and variables, and we’ll learn some other concepts as well in this chapter.\n\n\nComments are any text to the right of the # symbol and is mainly useful as notes for the reader of the program.\nFor example:\nprint('hello world') # Note that print is a function\nor:\n# Note that print is a function\nprint('hello world')\nUse as many useful comments as you can in your program to:\n\nexplain assumptions\nexplain important decisions\nexplain important details\nexplain problems you’re trying to solve\nexplain problems you’re trying to overcome in your program, etc.\n\nCode tells you how, comments should tell you why.\nThis is useful for readers of your program so that they can easily understand what the program is doing. Remember, that person can be yourself after six months!\n\n\n\nAn example of a literal constant is a number like 5, 1.23, or a string like 'This is a string' or \"It's a string!\".\nIt is called a literal because it is literal - you use its value literally. The number 2 always represents itself and nothing else - it is a constant because its value cannot be changed. Hence, all these are referred to as literal constants.\n\n\n\nNumbers are mainly of two types - integers and floats.\nAn example of an integer is 2 which is just a whole number.\nExamples of floating point numbers (or floats for short) are 3.23 and 52.3E-4. The E notation indicates powers of 10. In this case, 52.3E-4 means 52.3 * 10^-4^.\n\nNote for Experienced Programmers\nThere is no separate long type. The int type can be an integer of any size.\n\n\n\n\nA string is a sequence of characters. Strings are basically just a bunch of words.\nYou will be using strings in almost every Python program that you write, so pay attention to the following part.\n\n\nYou can specify strings using single quotes such as 'Quote me on this'.\nAll white space i.e. spaces and tabs, within the quotes, are preserved as-is.\n\n\n\nStrings in double quotes work exactly the same way as strings in single quotes. An example is \"What's your name?\".\n\n\n\nYou can specify multi-line strings using triple quotes - (\"\"\" or '''). You can use single quotes and double quotes freely within the triple quotes. An example is:\n'''This is a multi-line string. This is the first line.\nThis is the second line.\n\"What's your name?,\" I asked.\nHe said \"Bond, James Bond.\"\n'''\n\n\n\nThis means that once you have created a string, you cannot change it. Although this might seem like a bad thing, it really isn’t. We will see why this is not a limitation in the various programs that we see later on.\n\nNote for C/C++ Programmers\nThere is no separate char data type in Python. There is no real need for it and I am sure you won’t miss it.\n\n\n\nNote for Perl/PHP Programmers\nRemember that single-quoted strings and double-quoted strings are the same - they do not differ in any way.\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we may want to construct strings from other information. This is where the format() method is useful.\nSave the following lines as a file str_format.py:\nage = 20\nname = 'Swaroop'\n\nprint('{0} was {1} years old when he wrote this book'.format(name, age))\nprint('Why is {0} playing with that python?'.format(name))\nOutput:\n$ python str_format.py\nSwaroop was 20 years old when he wrote this book\nWhy is Swaroop playing with that python?\nHow It Works\nA string can use certain specifications and subsequently, the format method can be called to substitute those specifications with corresponding arguments to the format method.\nObserve the first usage where we use {0} and this corresponds to the variable name which is the first argument to the format method. Similarly, the second specification is {1} corresponding to age which is the second argument to the format method. Note that Python starts counting from 0 which means that first position is at index 0, second position is at index 1, and so on.\nNotice that we could have achieved the same using string concatenation:\nname + ' is ' + str(age) + ' years old'\nbut that is much uglier and more error-prone. Second, the conversion to string would be done automatically by the format method instead of the explicit conversion to strings needed in this case. Third, when using the format method, we can change the message without having to deal with the variables used and vice-versa.\nAlso note that the numbers are optional, so you could have also written as:\nage = 20\nname = 'Swaroop'\n\nprint('{} was {} years old when he wrote this book'.format(name, age))\nprint('Why is {} playing with that python?'.format(name))\nwhich will give the same exact output as the previous program.\nWe can also name the parameters:\nage = 20\nname = 'Swaroop'\n\nprint('{name} was {age} years old when he wrote this book'.format(name=name, age=age))\nprint('Why is {name} playing with that python?'.format(name=name))\nwhich will give the same exact output as the previous program.\nPython 3.6 introduced a shorter way to do named parameters, called “f-strings”:\nage = 20\nname = 'Swaroop'\n\nprint(f'{name} was {age} years old when he wrote this book')  # notice the 'f' before the string\nprint(f'Why is {name} playing with that python?')  # notice the 'f' before the string\nwhich will give the same exact output as the previous program.\nWhat Python does in the format method is that it substitutes each argument value into the place of the specification. There can be more detailed specifications such as:\n# decimal (.) precision of 3 for float '0.333'\nprint('{0:.3f}'.format(1.0/3))\n# fill with underscores (_) with the text centered\n# (^) to 11 width '___hello___'\nprint('{0:_^11}'.format('hello'))\n# keyword-based 'Swaroop wrote A Byte of Python'\nprint('{name} wrote {book}'.format(name='Swaroop', book='A Byte of Python'))\nOutput:\n0.333\n___hello___\nSwaroop wrote A Byte of Python\nSince we are discussing formatting, note that print always ends with an invisible “new line” character (\\n) so that repeated calls to print will all print on a separate line each. To prevent this newline character from being printed, you can specify that it should end with a blank:\nprint('a', end='')\nprint('b', end='')\nOutput is:\nab\nOr you can end with a space:\nprint('a', end=' ')\nprint('b', end=' ')\nprint('c')\nOutput is:\na b c\n\n\n\nSince the default end parameter is set to \\n it always prints one line break by default. We can change end to \\n\\n to print two line breaks – that creates an empty line after whatever the print statement output.\nprint(\"This is a line\", end = \"\\n\\n\") \nWe can also use print with no arguments to print just an empty line:\nprint() # prints an empty line \n\n\n\nSuppose, you want to have a string which contains a single quote ('), how will you specify this string? For example, the string is \"What's your name?\". You cannot specify 'What's your name?' because Python will be confused as to where the string starts and ends. So, you will have to specify that this single quote does not indicate the end of the string. This can be done with the help of what is called an escape sequence. You specify the single quote as \\' : notice the backslash. Now, you can specify the string as 'What\\'s your name?'.\nAnother way of specifying this specific string would be \"What's your name?\" i.e. using double quotes. Similarly, you have to use an escape sequence for using a double quote itself in a double quoted string. Also, you have to indicate the backslash itself using the escape sequence \\\\.\nWhat if you wanted to specify a two-line string? One way is to use a triple-quoted string as shown previously or you can use an escape sequence for the newline character - \\n to indicate the start of a new line. An example is:\n'This is the first line\\nThis is the second line'\nAnother useful escape sequence to know is the tab: \\t. There are many more escape sequences but I have mentioned only the most useful ones here.\nOne thing to note is that in a string, a single backslash at the end of the line indicates that the string is continued in the next line, but no newline is added. For example:\n\"This is the first sentence. \\\nThis is the second sentence.\"\nis equivalent to\n\"This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence.\"\n\n\n\nIf you need to specify some strings where no special processing such as escape sequences are handled, then what you need is to specify a raw string by prefixing r or R to the string. An example is:\nr\"Newlines are indicated by \\n\"\n\nNote for Regular Expression Users\nAlways use raw strings when dealing with regular expressions. Otherwise, a lot of backwhacking may be required. For example, backreferences can be referred to as '\\\\1' or r'\\1'.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing just literal constants can soon become boring - we need some way of storing any information and manipulate them as well. This is where variables come into the picture. Variables are exactly what the name implies - their value can vary, i.e., you can store anything using a variable. Variables are just parts of your computer’s memory where you store some information. Unlike literal constants, you need some method of accessing these variables and hence you give them names.\n\n\n\nVariables are examples of identifiers. Identifiers are names given to identify something. There are some rules you have to follow for naming identifiers:\n\nThe first character of the identifier must be a letter of the alphabet (uppercase ASCII or lowercase ASCII or Unicode character) or an underscore (_).\nThe rest of the identifier name can consist of letters (uppercase ASCII or lowercase ASCII or Unicode character), underscores (_) or digits (0-9).\nIdentifier names are case-sensitive. For example, myname and myName are not the same. Note the lowercase n in the former and the uppercase N in the latter.\nExamples of valid identifier names are i, name_2_3. Examples of invalid identifier names are 2things, this is spaced out, my-name and &gt;a1b2_c3.\n\n\n\n\nVariables can hold values of different types called data types. The basic types are numbers and strings, which we have already discussed.\n\n\n\nRemember, Python refers to anything used in a program as an object. This is meant in the generic sense. Instead of saying “the something”’, we say “the object”.\n\nNote for Object Oriented Programming users:\nPython is strongly object-oriented in the sense that everything is an object including numbers, strings and functions.\n\nWe will now see how to use variables along with literal constants. Save the following example and run the program.\n\n\n\nNow that we have gone through many nitty-gritty details, we can move on to more interesting stuff such as functions. Be sure to become comfortable with what you have read in this chapter.",

    "text": "Python is one of those rare languages which can claim to be both simple and powerful. You will find yourself pleasantly surprised to see how easy it is to concentrate on the solution to the problem rather than the syntax and structure of the language you are programming in.\nThe official introduction to Python is:\n\nPython is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.\n\nI will discuss most of these features in more detail in the next section.\n\n\nGuido van Rossum, the creator of the Python language, named the language after the BBC show “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”.

We generate this sequence of numbers using the built-in range function.\nWhat we do here is supply it two numbers and range returns a sequence of numbers starting from the first number and up to the second number. For example, range(1,5) gives the sequence [1, 2, 3, 4]. By default, range takes a step count of 1. If we supply a third number to range, then that becomes the step count. For example, range(1,5,2) gives [1,3]. Remember that the range extends up to the second number i.e. it does not include the second number.\nNote that range() generates only one number at a time, if you want the full list of numbers, call list() on the range(), for example, list(range(5)) will result in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. Lists are explained in the data structures chapter.\nThe for loop then iterates over this range - for i in range(1,5) is equivalent to for i in [1, 2, 3, 4] which is like assigning each number (or object) in the sequence to i, one at a time, and then executing the block of statements for each value of i. In this case, we just print the value in the block of statements.\nRemember that the else part is optional. When included, it is always executed once after the for loop is over unless a break statement is encountered.\nRemember that the for..in loop works for any sequence. Here, we have a list of numbers generated by the built-in range function, but in general we can use any kind of sequence of any kind of objects! We will explore this idea in detail in later chapters.\n\nNote for C/C++/Java/C# Programmers\nThe Python for loop is radically different from the C/C++ for loop. C# programmers will note that the for loop in Python is similar to the foreach loop in C#. Java programmers will note that the same is similar to for (int i : IntArray) in Java 1.5.\nIn C/C++, if you want to write for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++), then in Python you write just for i in range(0,5). As you can see, the for loop is simpler, more expressive and less error prone in Python.\n\n\n\n\nWe have seen how to use the three control flow statements - if, while and for statements.

    "text": "The while statement allows you to repeatedly execute a block of statements as long as a condition is true. A while statement is an example of what is called a looping statement. A while statement can have an optional else clause.\nExample:\ndef guessing_game(number):\n  running = True\n  while running:\n      guess = int(input('Enter an integer : '))\n  \n      if guess == number:\n          print('Congratulations, you guessed it.')\n          # this causes the while loop to stop\n          running = False\n      elif guess &lt; number:\n          print('No, it is a little higher than that.')\n      else:\n          print('No, it is a little lower than that.')\n  else:\n      print('The while loop is over.')\n      # Do anything else you want to do here\n\ndef main():\n  number = 23\n  guessing_game(number)\n  print('Done')\n  \nmain()\nOutput:\n\nEnter an integer : 50\nNo, it is a little lower than that.\nEnter an integer : 22\nNo, it is a little higher than that.\nEnter an integer : 23\nCongratulations, you guessed it.\nThe while loop is over.\nDone\n\nHow It Works\nIn this program, we are still playing the guessing game, but the advantage is that the user is allowed to keep guessing until he guesses correctly - there is no need to repeatedly run the program for each guess, as we have done in the previous section. This aptly demonstrates the use of the while statement.\nWe move the input and if statements to inside the while loop and set the variable running to True before the while loop. First, we check if the variable running is True and then proceed to execute the corresponding while-block. After this block is executed, the condition is again checked which in this case is the running variable. If it is true, we execute the while-block again, else we continue to execute the optional else-block and then continue to the next statement.\nThe else block is executed when the while loop condition becomes False - this may even be the first time that the condition is checked. If there is an else clause for a while loop, it is always executed unless you break out of the loop with a break statement.\nThe True and False are called Boolean types and you can consider them to be equivalent to the value 1 and 0 respectively.\n\nNote for C/C++ Programmers\nRemember that you can have an else clause for the while loop.\n\n\n\nWe have seen how to use the while statement.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Data structures are basically just that - they are structures which can hold some data together. In other words, they are used to store a collection of related data.\nThere are four built-in data structures in Python. In this module, we will see how to use lists and how they make life easier for us.\n\n\nA list is a data structure that holds an ordered collection of items i.e. you can store a sequence of items in a list. This is easy to imagine if you can think of a shopping list where you have a list of items to buy, except that you probably have each item on a separate line in your shopping list whereas in Python you put commas in between them.\nThe list of items should be enclosed in square brackets so that Python understands that you are specifying a list. Once you have created a list, you can add, remove or search for items in the list. Since we can add and remove items, we say that a list is a mutable data type i.e. this type can be altered.\nExample:\nshoplist = ['apple', 'mango', 'carrot', 'banana']\nname = 'swaroop'\n\n# Indexing or 'Subscription' operation #\nprint('Item 0 is', shoplist[0])\nprint('Item 1 is', shoplist[1])\nprint('Item 2 is', shoplist[2])\nprint('Item 3 is', shoplist[3])\nprint('Item -1 is', shoplist[-1])\nprint('Item -2 is', shoplist[-2])\nprint('Character 0 is', name[0])\n\n# Slicing on a list #\nprint('Item 1 to 3 is', shoplist[1:3])\nprint('Item 2 to end is', shoplist[2:])\nprint('Item 1 to -1 is', shoplist[1:-1])\nprint('Item start to end is', shoplist[:])\n\n# Slicing on a string #\nprint('characters 1 to 3 is', name[1:3])\nprint('characters 2 to end is', name[2:])\nprint('characters 1 to -1 is', name[1:-1])\nprint('characters start to end is', name[:])\nOutput:\n\nItem 0 is apple\nItem 1 is mango\nItem 2 is carrot\nItem 3 is banana\nItem -1 is banana\nItem -2 is carrot\nCharacter 0 is s\nItem 1 to 3 is ['mango', 'carrot']\nItem 2 to end is ['carrot', 'banana']\nItem 1 to -1 is ['mango', 'carrot']\nItem start to end is ['apple', 'mango', 'carrot', 'banana']\ncharacters 1 to 3 is wa\ncharacters 2 to end is aroop\ncharacters 1 to -1 is waroo\ncharacters start to end is swaroop\n\nHow It Works\nFirst, we see how to use indexes to get individual items of a list or a string (also known as sequences). This is also referred to as the subscription operation. Whenever you specify a number to a sequence within square brackets as shown above, Python will fetch you the item corresponding to that position in the sequence. Remember that Python starts counting numbers from 0. Hence, shoplist[0] fetches the first item and shoplist[3] fetches the fourth item in the shoplist sequence.\nThe index can also be a negative number, in which case, the position is calculated from the end of the sequence. Therefore, shoplist[-1] refers to the last item in the sequence and shoplist[-2] fetches the second last item in the sequence.\nThe slicing operation is used by specifying the name of the sequence followed by an optional pair of numbers separated by a colon within square brackets. Note that this is very similar to the indexing operation you have been using till now. Remember the numbers are optional but the colon isn’t.\nThe first number (before the colon) in the slicing operation refers to the position from where the slice starts and the second number (after the colon) indicates where the slice will stop at. If the first number is not specified, Python will start at the beginning of the sequence. If the second number is left out, Python will stop at the end of the sequence.

    "text": "A list is a data structure that holds an ordered collection of items i.e. you can store a sequence of items in a list. This is easy to imagine if you can think of a shopping list where you have a list of items to buy, except that you probably have each item on a separate line in your shopping list whereas in Python you put commas in between them.\nThe list of items should be enclosed in square brackets so that Python understands that you are specifying a list. Once you have created a list, you can add, remove or search for items in the list. Since we can add and remove items, we say that a list is a mutable data type i.e. this type can be altered.\nExample:\nshoplist = ['apple', 'mango', 'carrot', 'banana']\nname = 'swaroop'\n\n# Indexing or 'Subscription' operation #\nprint('Item 0 is', shoplist[0])\nprint('Item 1 is', shoplist[1])\nprint('Item 2 is', shoplist[2])\nprint('Item 3 is', shoplist[3])\nprint('Item -1 is', shoplist[-1])\nprint('Item -2 is', shoplist[-2])\nprint('Character 0 is', name[0])\n\n# Slicing on a list #\nprint('Item 1 to 3 is', shoplist[1:3])\nprint('Item 2 to end is', shoplist[2:])\nprint('Item 1 to -1 is', shoplist[1:-1])\nprint('Item start to end is', shoplist[:])\n\n# Slicing on a string #\nprint('characters 1 to 3 is', name[1:3])\nprint('characters 2 to end is', name[2:])\nprint('characters 1 to -1 is', name[1:-1])\nprint('characters start to end is', name[:])\nOutput:\n\nItem 0 is apple\nItem 1 is mango\nItem 2 is carrot\nItem 3 is banana\nItem -1 is banana\nItem -2 is carrot\nCharacter 0 is s\nItem 1 to 3 is ['mango', 'carrot']\nItem 2 to end is ['carrot', 'banana']\nItem 1 to -1 is ['mango', 'carrot']\nItem start to end is ['apple', 'mango', 'carrot', 'banana']\ncharacters 1 to 3 is wa\ncharacters 2 to end is aroop\ncharacters 1 to -1 is waroo\ncharacters start to end is swaroop\n\nHow It Works\nFirst, we see how to use indexes to get individual items of a list or a string (also known as sequences). This is also referred to as the subscription operation. Whenever you specify a number to a sequence within square brackets as shown above, Python will fetch you the item corresponding to that position in the sequence. Remember that Python starts counting numbers from 0. Hence, shoplist[0] fetches the first item and shoplist[3] fetches the fourth item in the shoplist sequence.\nThe index can also be a negative number, in which case, the position is calculated from the end of the sequence. Therefore, shoplist[-1] refers to the last item in the sequence and shoplist[-2] fetches the second last item in the sequence.\nThe slicing operation is used by specifying the name of the sequence followed by an optional pair of numbers separated by a colon within square brackets. Note that this is very similar to the indexing operation you have been using till now. Remember the numbers are optional but the colon isn’t.\nThe first number (before the colon) in the slicing operation refers to the position from where the slice starts and the second number (after the colon) indicates where the slice will stop at. If the first number is not specified, Python will start at the beginning of the sequence. If the second number is left out, Python will stop at the end of the sequence. Note that the slice returned starts at the start position and will end just before the end position i.e. the start position is included but the end position is excluded from the sequence slice.\nThus, shoplist[1:3] returns a slice of the sequence starting at position 1, includes position 2 but stops at position 3 and therefore a slice of two items is returned. Similarly, shoplist[:] returns a copy of the whole sequence.\nYou can also do slicing with negative positions. Negative numbers are used for positions from the end of the sequence. For example, shoplist[:-1] will return a slice of the sequence which excludes the last item of the sequence but contains everything else."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Tuples (Data Structures)\nTuples are used to hold together multiple objects. Think of them as similar to lists, but without the extensive functionality that the list class gives you. One major feature of tuples is that they are immutable like strings i.e. you cannot modify tuples.\nTuples are defined by specifying items separated by commas within an optional pair of parentheses.\nTuples are usually used in cases where a statement or a user-defined function can safely assume that the collection of values (i.e. the tuple of values used) will not change.\nExample:\n# I would recommend always using parentheses\n# to indicate start and end of tuple\n# even though parentheses are optional.\n# Explicit is better than implicit.\nzoo = ('python', 'elephant', 'penguin')\nprint('Number of animals in the zoo is', len(zoo))\n\nnew_zoo = 'monkey', 'camel', zoo    # parentheses not required but are a good idea\nprint('Number of cages in the new zoo is', len(new_zoo))\nprint('All animals in new zoo are', new_zoo)\nprint('Animals brought from old zoo are', new_zoo[2])\nprint('Last animal brought from old zoo is', new_zoo[2][2])\nprint('Number of animals in the new zoo is',\n      len(new_zoo)-1+len(new_zoo[2]))\nOutput:\n\nNumber of animals in the zoo is 3\nNumber of cages in the new zoo is 3\nAll animals in new zoo are ('monkey', 'camel', ('python', 'elephant', 'penguin'))\nAnimals brought from old zoo are ('python', 'elephant', 'penguin')\nLast animal brought from old zoo is penguin\nNumber of animals in the new zoo is 5\n\nHow It Works\nThe variable zoo refers to a tuple of items. We see that the len function can be used to get the length of the tuple. This also indicates that a tuple is a sequence as well.\nWe are now shifting these animals to a new zoo since the old zoo is being closed. Therefore, the new_zoo tuple contains some animals which are already there along with the animals brought over from the old zoo. Back to reality, note that a tuple within a tuple does not lose its identity.\nWe can access the items in the tuple by specifying the item’s position within a pair of square brackets just like we did for lists. This is called the indexing operator. We access the third item in new_zoo by specifying new_zoo[2] and we access the third item within the third item in the new_zoo tuple by specifying new_zoo[2][2]. This is pretty simple once you’ve understood the idiom.\n\nTuple with 0 or 1 items\nAn empty tuple is constructed by an empty pair of parentheses such as myempty = (). However, a tuple with a single item is not so simple. You have to specify it using a comma following the first (and only) item so that Python can differentiate between a tuple and a pair of parentheses surrounding the object in an expression i.e. you have to specify singleton = (2 , ) if you mean you want a tuple containing the item 2.\n\n\n\nNote for Perl programmers\nA list within a list does not lose its identity i.e. lists are not flattened as in Perl. The same applies to a tuple within a tuple, or a tuple within a list, or a list within a tuple, etc. As far as Python is concerned, they are just objects stored using another object, that’s all."

    "text": "Formative assessment\nThe assignments, quizzes and exams in this course are designed to give students and instructors information on how well students are learning the materials. In other words, all assessment is meant to help you learn.\nYou should see the grades you get for these assessments as a way to adjust your studying, for example:\n\nIf you are doing well in the coding assignments, but not on quizzes, that means you are not completely grasping the concepts we are covering – try solving the coding assignments without any assistance and on paper\nIf you are not doing well on the projects, that means you probably need to block more time over multiple days to figure projects out\n\nYou will notice that assessment is frequent in this class – there is either a midterm or a quiz every Wednesday, and there are coding assignments every week. The purpose of frequent assignments is to provide students with frequent feedback, so they realize what concepts they need to practice more.\n\n\nAutomated grading\nFor the assignments you submit through gradescope, an autograder is run on your code. That means the instructors for this course wrote tests to check the output of your code.\nFor example, if you are asked to write a function that takes in a number n as argument and returns double that value, the tests that would be run would be whether your function returns 4 when the argument is 2 and -8 when the argument is -4 (and so on).\nHere are the reasons for this type of grading:\n\nWhen writing code, programmers write this type of test themselves to check whether their code works as expected (you can read more about unit testing, if you are interested)\nThis type of testing of code scales well – that means that 500 students can get instant feedback on their code at once (feedback is really important, like mentioned in the previous section of this document)\n\nThis type of grading might seem very strict, because you either pass the test or you don’t (there’s no partial credit for trying hard). That is how computers work – if I want to know what 10 times 10 is and your code says it is 99, that answer is incorrect. You are not “close” to the correct answer, so there is no partial credit awarded, because the answer is 100% incorrect.\n\n\nExams and quizzes\nThe exams and quizzes for this class are all on paper. The coding questions will be short, and you won’t be writing more than 10 lines of code per solution (most of the time your solution should be around 5 lines of code).\nThe same rules that we have for the autograder tests (see previous section) apply for grading code on paper – your code is either right or wrong. We do award partial credit if there are up to two minor syntax errors (for example, you forgot the : at the end of your conditional statement). If your solution is not generalizable and does not return the correct values, you will not be awarded any points for it.\nAgain, some students find this grading “unfair” because it does not take into account their effort to answer the question. The goal, however, is to assess whether you understand the logic of how to solve the problem and you know how to do so in Python syntax. If you do not demonstrate that you know how to solve the problem, you will be awarded a zero.",

You need to do it yourself, and you need to practice it on a daily basis.\n\nWhat do you need to succeed in this class?\nA willingness to:\n\ntry and fail\nget frustrated and bored\nbe curious about how things work\n\n\n\nCome to office hours prepared\nYou should come to office hours to get help when you are stuck, but you should try to work the assignment out on your own before seeking help.\nYou should not come to office hours to have the TA explain what to do.\nOnce you get help, and understand why you were stuck, you should solve the problem/assignment again on your own once you get back from office hours.\n\n\nPractice every day\nIn addition to the assignments you submit to gradescope, I also make available practice problems so you have plenty of programming problems to practice. And you should solve this on your own, multiple times.\nCoding is not about memorization – it’s about knowing how to think computationally. You will only learn how to do that by practicing.\nPracticing is not having your friend/AI tell you how to solve a problem. If you want to be a piano player, you have to play the piano yourself.\nUse a calendar and block out 45-60 minutes a day to practice your coding skills.\nThe university expectation is that you will spend 2-3 hours on out-of-class work for every 1 credit unit – so you are expected to spend 8-12 hours working on homework and studying for CSC 110 in addition to attending lectures, actively engaging in in-class-activities, and coming to your weekly lab session.\nSolve assignments, quizzes, exams, and practice problems again and again on paper and time yourself.\n\n\nTake breaks often\nDo not expect to put in 10 hours of work on one day to get your code to work. That’s not how coding works. You often need to allow your brain to process things across multiple days. Working at a problem for 5+ hours straight will get you frustrated, and you won’t be able to see where the bug is.\nIf you are feeling frustrated, take a break, walk away from the problem for a few hours. Ideally, go back to the problem after getting some sleep.\nThat is why it is important to start working on assignments early on.\n\n\nWhat is the role of the TAs?\n\nThe TAs are not responsible for debugging your code extensively with you, they are to give you some direction if you get stuck.\nThe TAs can go over concepts covered in class if you have specific questions. It is okay for you to ask TAs: “Can you explain the different between a for loop to get the indices in a list and a for loop to get the items from a list?” – It is not okay for you to ask TAs to go over an entire lecture with you. They are not private tutors.",

    "text": "Input from user\nThere will be situations where your program has to interact with the user. For example, you would want to take input from the user and then print some results back. We can achieve this using the input() function and print function respectively.\nExample:\ndef say_hi(name):\n  print(\"Hello,\", name + \"!\")\n  \nname = input(\"What's your name?\\n\")\nsay_hi(name)\nOutput:\n\nWhat's your name?\nAdriana\nHello, Adriana!\n\nHow It Works\nThe input() function takes a string as argument and saves it to a variable called name. Then it calls the function say_hi() with the name entered by the user as the argument. The function say_hi() prints the name argument concatenated with a Hello message.\n\n\nChanging types\nThe input() function will always return a string. But many times we will want the user to enter other information, such as a number.\nWe can use functions like int() to transform a type into an integer and float() to transform a type into a float number.\nExample:\ndef calculate_future(years, age):\n  print(\"In\", years, \"you will be\", age + years, \"years old.\")\n\n\nage = input(\"What's your age?\\n\")\nage_int = int(age)\ncalculate_future(10, age_int)\nOutput:\n\nWhat's your age?\n41\nIn 10 you will be 51 years old.\n\nHow It Works\nThe input() function takes a string as argument and saves it to a variable called age. Then it calls the function int() to convert the age entered by the user from string to integer and saves the value to a variable called age_int. The function calculate_future() is called with arguments 10 and the age entered by the user converted to integer, it then prints the age argument concatenated with a message saying how old the person will be in the number of years passed as argument to the function."

    "text": "There are two types of objects in Python, mutable and immutable. When we assign a variable, we are creating a reference to the object. In other words, the variable name “points” to the object in memory.\nA variable does not actually hold the value of the object within it. Instead, a variable is a reference to the object. The object “lives” somewhere in your computer’s memory (RAM). When you assign a value to a new variable, the variable references that object. If you assign the same variable name to a new object, the new object is created, placed in memory, and the the variable references it.\nMost values in Python (strings, lists, integers, floats, booleans) are objects. Mutable objects can be changed once they are created. Immutable objects cannot be changed once they are created.\nImmutable objects in Python include integers, floats, strings, and tuples (we will work with tuples in the future, no need to worry about them now). Lists are mutable. (so are dictionaries, which we will also be working with in the future)\nHere’s how we can change a list:\nsongs = [\"Lavender Haze\", \"Calm Down\", \"As It Was\", \"About Damn Time\"]\nsongs\n\n['Lavender Haze', 'Calm Down', 'As It Was', 'About Damn Time']\nsongs[0] = \"Flowers\"\nsongs\n\n['Flowers', 'Calm Down', 'As It Was', 'About Damn Time']\nNote that although we can retrieve values from a string using [ ], we are unable to change a character inside a string using indexing because strings are immutable."

In this case, Python will not evaluate y since it knows that the left hand side of the ‘and’ expression is False which implies that the whole expression will be False irrespective of the other values. This is called short-circuit evaluation.\n\nor (boolean OR)\n\nIf x is True, it returns True, else it returns evaluation of y\nx = True; y = False; x or y returns True. Short-circuit evaluation applies here as well.\n\n\n\n\nHere’s the updated table with the evaluation order, from the highest precedence to the lowest precedence. This means that in a given expression, Python will first evaluate the operators and expressions first in the table before the ones listed last in the table. It is far better to use parentheses to group operators and operands appropriately in order to explicitly specify the precedence. This makes the program more readable.\n\n(expressions...)\n** : Exponentiation\n*, /, //, % : Multiplication, Division, Floor Division and Remainder\n+, - : Addition and subtraction\n&lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, !=, == : Comparisons, including membership tests and identity tests\nnot x : Boolean NOT\nand : Boolean AND\nor : Boolean OR\n\nThe operators which we have not already come across will be explained in later chapters.\nOperators with the same precedence are listed in the same row in the above table.

We then print it using the print function.\nAlso, notice how Python pretty-prints the output, with spaces between Is and 10 and larger than.

At the end of the semester, if at least two-thirds of the students have submitted class\nevaluations, we replaced your lowest midterm exam score with a percentage-equivalent copy of your final exam score, if the final exam score is higher than your lowest midterm score. We do this not only to encourage class evaluations, but also to reward you for demonstrating an improved mastery of the material over the course of the semester. If you would like an exam regraded, we reserve the right to regrade the entire exam, not only the parts you might question.\nThere are a number of quizzes that will be scheduled throughout the semester depending on how quickly course material is covered. However many end up being given, only the best 5 will count toward the quiz category. Make-up quizzes are not given.\nFinal Examination\nThe final exam is worth 16%.\nThe final exam date, time and room is: 05/13/26, 3:30pm-5:30pm, M Pacheco ILC, Rm 140.\nYou must keep this time available. Do not schedule any flights, travel plans, or other conflicts with this exam.\nSee also: Final Exam Regulations and Final Exam Schedule:\nGrading Scale and Policies\nThe instructor and teaching staff will do their best to have grades back to students within 1 week. This includes, but is not limited to, grades for exams, projects, programming assignments, attendance, and quizzes. Once a grade has been entered for a particular item on the digital grade-book, students have at most 5 days to dispute the grade. This includes disputes related to excuses such as sickness, personal matters, dean’s excuses, etc. If 5 days pass and there has not been such a request, the grade is final.\nAppeals submitted after this period will not be considered by the instructor or teaching staff under any circumstances. Please review your grades promptly and plan accordingly.\nThe correspondence between percentage grade and numeric grade is as follows:\nGreater or equal to 90% at least an A\nGreater or equal to 80% at least a B\nGreater or equal to 70% at least a C\nGreater or equal to 60% at least a D\nAnything less, at least an E / F\nDepartment of Computer Science Grading Policy:\nInstructors will explicitly promise when every assignment and exam will be graded and returned to students. These promised dates will appear in the syllabus, associated with the corresponding due dates and exam dates.\nGraded homework will be returned before the next homework is due. Exams will be returned “promptly”,\n3 1/14/26\nas defined by the instructor (and as promised in the syllabus). Grading delays beyond promised return-by dates will be announced as soon as possible with an explanation for the delay.\nLate work is accepted for homeworks and programming assignments up to two days after the assigned due date. If it is submitted within one day of the assigned due date, there will be a 20% deduction from the final grade for the assignment. If it is submitted on the second day after the assigned due date, there will be a 40% deduction from the final grade for the assignment. After two days have passed beyond the assigned due date, no submissions will be accepted.\nIncomplete (I) or Withdrawal (W):\nRequests for incomplete (I) or withdrawal (W) must be made in accordance with University policies, which are available at\nTopic Outlin\nTopics may be added, removed, or reordered as time and circumstances dictate, however, advance warning will be provided in such cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics and Subtopics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopic 1 (Review) A: Basic Data Structures\n\n\n5, (S) 4.1-4.3, Lecture\n\n\nReview Lists, Stacks, and Queues.

instructors have a shared responsibility. We want a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment where all of us feel comfortable with each other and where we can challenge ourselves to succeed. To that end, our focus is on the tasks at hand and not on extraneous activities (e.g., texting, chatting, reading a newspaper, making phone calls, web surfing, etc.).\nStudents are asked to refrain from disruptive conversations with people sitting around them during lecture. Students observed engaging in disruptive activity will be asked to cease this behavior. Those who continue to disrupt the class will be asked to leave lecture or discussion and may be reported to the Dean of Students.\nSafety on Campus and in the Classroom\n\nFor a list of emergency procedures for all types of incidents, please visit the website of the Critical Incident\n\nResponse Team (CIRT):\nAlso watch the video available at\nUniversity-wide Policies link\nLinks to the following UA policies are provided here:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n\n\nAbsence and Class Participation Policies\nThreatening Behavior Policy\nAccessibility and Accommodations Policy\nCode of Academic Integrity\nNondiscrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy Class Recordings\nAdditional Resources\nPreferred Names and Pronouns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartment-wide Syllabus Policies and Resources link\nresources are provided here, :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n●\n●\n●\n●\n●\n\n\nDepartment Code of Conduct\nIllnesses and Emergencies\nObtaining Help\nConfidentiality of Student Records\nLand Acknowledgement Statement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubject to Change Statement\nInformation contained in the course syllabus, other than the grade and absence policy, may be subject to change with advance notice, as deemed appropriate by the instructor.\n\n\n\n\n6 1/14/26",
