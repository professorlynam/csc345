    "section": "",
    "text": "Input from user\nThere will be situations where your program has to interact with the user. For example, you would want to take input from the user and then print some results back. We can achieve this using the input() function and print function respectively.\nExample:\ndef say_hi(name):\n  print(\"Hello,\", name + \"!\")\n  \nname = input(\"What's your name?\\n\")\nsay_hi(name)\nOutput:\n\nWhat's your name?\nAdriana\nHello, Adriana!\n\nHow It Works\nThe input() function takes a string as argument and saves it to a variable called name. Then it calls the function say_hi() with the name entered by the user as the argument. The function say_hi() prints the name argument concatenated with a Hello message.\n\n\nChanging types\nThe input() function will always return a string. But many times we will want the user to enter other information, such as a number.\nWe can use functions like int() to transform a type into an integer and float() to transform a type into a float number.\nExample:\ndef calculate_future(years, age):\n  print(\"In\", years, \"you will be\", age + years, \"years old.\")\n\n\nage = input(\"What's your age?\\n\")\nage_int = int(age)\ncalculate_future(10, age_int)\nOutput:\n\nWhat's your age?\n41\nIn 10 you will be 51 years old.\n\nHow It Works\nThe input() function takes a string as argument and saves it to a variable called age. Then it calls the function int() to convert the age entered by the user from string to integer and saves the value to a variable called age_int. The function calculate_future() is called with arguments 10 and the age entered by the user converted to integer, it then prints the age argument concatenated with a message saying how old the person will be in the number of years passed as argument to the function."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Formative assessment\nThe assignments, quizzes and exams in this course are designed to give students and instructors information on how well students are learning the materials. In other words, all assessment is meant to help you learn.\nYou should see the grades you get for these assessments as a way to adjust your studying, for example:\n\nIf you are doing well in the coding assignments, but not on quizzes, that means you are not completely grasping the concepts we are covering – try solving the coding assignments without any assistance and on paper\nIf you are not doing well on the projects, that means you probably need to block more time over multiple days to figure projects out\n\nYou will notice that assessment is frequent in this class – there is either a midterm or a quiz every Wednesday, and there are coding assignments every week. The purpose of frequent assignments is to provide students with frequent feedback, so they realize what concepts they need to practice more.\n\n\nAutomated grading\nFor the assignments you submit through gradescope, an autograder is run on your code. That means the instructors for this course wrote tests to check the output of your code.\nFor example, if you are asked to write a function that takes in a number n as argument and returns double that value, the tests that would be run would be whether your function returns 4 when the argument is 2 and -8 when the argument is -4 (and so on).\nHere are the reasons for this type of grading:\n\nWhen writing code, programmers write this type of test themselves to check whether their code works as expected (you can read more about unit testing, if you are interested)\nThis type of testing of code scales well – that means that 500 students can get instant feedback on their code at once (feedback is really important, like mentioned in the previous section of this document)\n\nThis type of grading might seem very strict, because you either pass the test or you don’t (there’s no partial credit for trying hard). That is how computers work – if I want to know what 10 times 10 is and your code says it is 99, that answer is incorrect. You are not “close” to the correct answer, so there is no partial credit awarded, because the answer is 100% incorrect.\n\n\nExams and quizzes\nThe exams and quizzes for this class are all on paper. The coding questions will be short, and you won’t be writing more than 10 lines of code per solution (most of the time your solution should be around 5 lines of code).\nThe same rules that we have for the autograder tests (see previous section) apply for grading code on paper – your code is either right or wrong. We do award partial credit if there are up to two minor syntax errors (for example, you forgot the : at the end of your conditional statement). If your solution is not generalizable and does not return the correct values, you will not be awarded any points for it.\nAgain, some students find this grading “unfair” because it does not take into account their effort to answer the question. The goal, however, is to assess whether you understand the logic of how to solve the problem and you know how to do so in Python syntax. If you do not demonstrate that you know how to solve the problem, you will be awarded a zero."

    "text": "Directions\nThis programming project is due February 10th at 3:30pm. You must turn in the program, including documentation, to Gradescope by the due date.\n\n\nIntroduction\nOnce upon a time, there was a hero from a far-off land. Their name was Logic, and they travelled far and wide, in search of the evil villain, Lord Bug. They sought revenge for something, though only they knew exactly what Lord Bug had done to offend them. In any case, Logic arrived in the Kingdom of Tucson, and sought the aid of the king: he needed help searching for Lord Bug, and he had heard of the king’s wisdom and intellect. The king solemnly agreed to the request, and of course, as soon as Logic left the room, turned to you, his royal advisor (the one who was actually wise and intelligent). Now you’re on the hook to develop a searching system… And you only have two weeks to do it!\n\n\nProblem Description\nLogic has a particular ability: they can teleport! But they haven’t trained their ability very well, so there is a significant limitation: when Logic tries to teleport to a destination they aren’t familiar with, they end up in a random spot within 50 miles of where they started. Now, Logic knows that Lord Bug is somewhere in a 100-mile by 100-mile square area, with the “center” square mile being (50, 50). This “center” square is where Logic starts the search from; this also the location of the throne room. The square mile immediately north of the “center” is (49, 50), and the square mile immediately east of the “center” is (50, 51). Logic wants a simple system to efficiently mark where they’ve been, and where they should search next. Fortunately, you’ve come up with a system for deciding how to search. The square mile that Logic randomly teleports to is called the RS. If the square miles to the north, south, east, and west of the RS (along with the RS itself) have been searched, then Logic should teleport back to the “center” square, and then to a new RS. Otherwise, they should search in the following pattern: the RS itself, then the spots, north, east, south, and west of the RS (in that order). Note that a spot should be skipped if it’s already been searched, or if it isn’t in the 100-mile by 100-mile square area. The “center” square is also considered to already have been searched. Traveling to an adjacent square mile takes 1 hour. Searching a square mile takes 2 hours. Logic returns to the “center” square mile to sleep every night. This is an issue because it can interrupt the search pattern, so your system will need to keep track of the number of hours to account for it. The search will begin at hour 0, and Logic can search for a maximum of 16 hours in a row before needing to return for sleep. Sleeping takes 8 hours exactly, and then they teleport to a new RS, and are able to search for a maximum of 16 hours. If there isn’t enough time to fully search another square mile before they have to return for sleep, they return and sleep early.\n\n\nAssignment\nWrite a well-documented, object-oriented program using Java 25 (it is recommended you do a fresh install of Java and whatever IDE you prefer to use) that takes in an input file of random spots, and outputs a list of searched spots and the number of hours the search took. Name this program: “search.java”. Your program will be graded on efficiency in addition to functionality. In particular, it should use a minimal amount of memory for the data structure used to keep track of the searched spots, and it should be able to quickly determine whether an adjacent spot has already been searched.\n\n\nInput\nThe input file, taken from a command line argument, will be a .txt file with a series of square mile coordinates, as shown in this example input file. Your program should run with a command line such as this: “java search input.txt”. The first line of the input file will indicate whether the output coordinates should be given by row or by column (“row” or “col”, respectively).\n\n\nOutput\nYour program should output to the terminal (‘stdout’) the series of square mile coordinates that have been searched, given the input file. Each coordinate should be separated by a new line, similar to the input file. Finally, the last line of output should have the total number of hours taken for the search. For the given input file, as an example, the output would be:\n“0 0\n0 1\n1 0\n4 5\n4 6\n5 5\n5 6\n5 7\n6 5\n6 6\n48”\n\n\nHints\nYou’ve recently learned about orthogonal lists, a data structure that would be perfect for this searching system! Since you must account for small input files which result in only a few spots searched, allocating a huge 100x100 array would be very inefficient. Consider how an appropriately set-up orthogonal list might help us solve this issue. You may also share input files with other students, as well as the associated terminal output, to ensure your code is well-tested. Finally, here is a table showing what the hour values would be after each square mile search, for the given sample input file.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Coding style refers to how you name your objects and functions, how you comment your code, how you use spacing throughout your code, etc. If your coding style is consistent, your code is easier to read and easier to debug as a result. Many companies enforce a specific coding style, and you won’t be able to push your code to the code base if your code does not pass the style check.\nThis style guide is a list of dos and don’ts for the programs you develop for the course.\n\nCSc 345: Style Guide\n\nExternal Documentation\n“External” Documentation: In programming classes, the comprehensive set of documents that detail the design, development, and structure of a program are usually condensed into a comparatively brief ‘block comment’ at the top of the source code. This “external” documentation will minimally include:\n\nYour name, the course name/#, assignment name/number, instructor and TA names, and due date.\nDetailed description (in your own words) of the problem the program was written to solve, including the techniques (e.g., algorithms, data structures) used to solve the problem.\nThe program’s operational requirements: Which programming language and version you used, special compilation information, where the input is located on disk, etc.\nRequired features of the assignment that you were not able to include, and/or information about bugs that are still known to exist. (Be honest and complete!)\n\n\n\nClass Documentation\nClass Documentation: When you write a support class (e.g., one not containing the application’s main() method), it will be preceded by a block comment minimally containing the following:\n\nThe name of the class, your name, the names of any external packages upon which your class depends, the name of the package of classes containing this class (if any), and inheritance information.\nAn explanation of purpose of the class.\nNames and brief descriptions of any public class constants and variables.\nNames and brief descriptions of constructors, plus a list of the implemented class and instance methods.\n\n\n\nInternal Documentation\nThe details of the program are explained by comments placed within the code. Your internal documentation will minimally include the following:\n\nA ‘block comment’ will be placed at the head of every method (a.k.a. function or subprogram). This will include the method name; the purpose of the method; the method’s pre– and post–conditions; the method’s return value (if any); and a list of all parameters, including direction of information transfer (into this method, out from the method back to the calling method, or both), and their purposes. Exception: A single block comment may cover all of the getter and setter methods of a class.\nMeaningful identifier names. In a nod to tradition, simple loop variables may have single letter variable names, but all others will be meaningful. Never use non-standard abbreviations. If your language has accepted naming conventions, learn and follow them.\nEach variable and constant must have a brief comment next to its declaration that explains its purpose. This applies to all variables, as well as to fields of structure declarations.\nComplex sections of code and any other parts of the program that need some explanation will have comments just ahead of them or embedded in them.\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous Requirements\n\nWrite programs with appropriate modularity; that is, create classes when appropriate, write methods that accomplish limited, well-defined tasks, etc.\nPublic (a.k.a. ‘global’) class and instance variables will never be used in your programs for my classes unless I have approved their use for your particular situation. Use getter/setter methods instead.\nBe generous with your use of “white space” (blank lines) to set off logically related sections of code.\nIndent bodies of methods, loops and IF statements, and do so with a single, consistent style.\nUnconditional branching (e.g., goto statements) may not be used in your programs w/o permission.\n\nIn general, if you have a choice between writing code that runs quickly and writing code that is easy to understand, make it easy to understand. Don’t sacrifice clarity for efficiency.\n\n\nReference\nThis guide is derived from Dr. Lester McCann’s CSc 345 style guide.",
