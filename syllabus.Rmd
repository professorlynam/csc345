> 140, TuTh 3:30pm-4:45pm**
>
> **Course Description**
>
> Introduction to and analysis of algorithms and characteristics of
> discrete structures. Course topics include algorithm analysis
> techniques, recurrence relations, structural induction, hierarchical
> structures, graphs, hashing, and sorting.
>
> **Course Prerequisites**
>
> Computer Science Advanced Standing. CSc 210 and CSc 244. In
> particular, you are expected to know the Java programming language; to
> be able to design, code, and debug programs consisting of hundreds of
> lines of object-oriented code; to understand and use basic common
> algorithms (e.g., sorting) and data structures (e.g., stacks); and to
> understand and apply basics of discrete mathematics, including the
> interpretation and creation of formal proofs.

> **Makeup Policy for Students Who Register Late**
>
> If you enroll in the class after the first graded activity has been
> assigned, please see the instructor to discuss possible adjustments to
> due dates.
>
> **Administrative Drops**
>
> Every semester, students enroll in CS classes but do not submit any
> work, resulting in a grade of \'E\' at the end of the term. To prevent
> this, after the end of the second week, I will be administratively
> dropping all students who have not submitted any activities collected
> prior to the no-W drop date.
>
> **Course Communications**\
> All online communication will be conducted through my official UA
> e-mail address (hlynam@arizona.edu), D2L, and Piazza. Ask questions on
> Piazza when you have questions about assignments, quizzes, and exams
> (has private options). Email the instructor only when you have
> logistics-related questions.

> **Required Texts or Readings**

> All readings, videos, and assignment instructions will be available on

> The breakdown of grades in this course is as follows:
>
> 30% Midterm Exams (2)
>
> 2 1/14/26
>
> 24% Programs (4)\
> 20% Homeworks (4)\
> 16% Final Exam\
> 10% Quizzes (best 5)
>
> There will be two midterm exams (each 15%) and a final exam (16%)
> throughout the course, for a total of 46%. At the end of the semester,
> if at least two-thirds of the students have submitted class\
> evaluations, we replaced your lowest midterm exam score with a
> percentage-equivalent copy of your final exam score, if the final exam
> score is higher than your lowest midterm score. We do this not only to

> an improved mastery of the material over the course of the semester.
> If you would like an exam regraded, we reserve the right to regrade
> the entire exam, not only the parts you might question.
>
> There are a number of quizzes that will be scheduled throughout the
> semester depending on how quickly course material is covered. However
> many end up being given, only the best 5 will count toward the quiz

> **Grading Scale and Policies**\
> The instructor and teaching staff will do their best to have grades
> back to students within 1 week. This includes, but is not limited to,
> grades for exams, projects, programming assignments, attendance, and
> quizzes. Once a grade has been entered for a particular item on the
> digital grade-book, students have **at most 5 days** to dispute the
> grade. This includes disputes related to excuses such as sickness,
> personal matters, dean's excuses, etc. If 5 days pass and there has
> not been such a request, the grade is final.
>
> Appeals submitted after this period will not be considered by the
> instructor or teaching staff under any circumstances. Please review
> your grades promptly and plan accordingly.
>
> The correspondence between percentage grade and numeric grade is as
> follows:
>
> Greater or equal to 90% at least an A
>
> Greater or equal to 80% at least a B
>
> Greater or equal to 70% at least a C
>
> Greater or equal to 60% at least a D
>
> Anything less, at least an E / F
>
> Department of Computer Science Grading Policy:
>
> Instructors will explicitly promise when every assignment and exam
> will be graded and returned to students. These promised dates will
> appear in the syllabus, associated with the corresponding due dates
> and exam dates.
>
> Graded homework will be returned before the next homework is due.
> Exams will be returned "promptly",
>
> 3 1/14/26
>
> as defined by the instructor (and as promised in the syllabus).
> Grading delays beyond promised return-by dates will be announced as
> soon as possible with an explanation for the delay.
>
> Late work is accepted for homeworks and programming assignments up to
> two days after the assigned due date. If it is submitted within one
> day of the assigned due date, there will be a 20% deduction from the
> final grade for the assignment. If it is submitted on the second day
> after the assigned due date, there will be a 40% deduction from the
> final grade for the assignment. After two days have passed beyond the
> assigned due date, no submissions will be accepted.

> **Classroom Behavior Policy**
>
> To foster a positive learning environment, students and instructors
> have a shared responsibility. We want a safe, welcoming, and inclusive
> environment where all of us feel comfortable with each other and where
> we can challenge ourselves to succeed. To that end, our focus is on
> the tasks at hand and not on extraneous activities (e.g., texting,
> chatting, reading a newspaper, making phone calls, web surfing, etc.).
>
> Students are asked to refrain from disruptive conversations with
> people sitting around them during lecture. Students observed engaging
> in disruptive activity will be asked to cease this behavior. Those who
> continue to disrupt the class will be asked to leave lecture or
> discussion and may be reported to the Dean of Students.

> **Safety on Campus and in the Classroom**
